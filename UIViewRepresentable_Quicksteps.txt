Easy peasy UIViewRepresentable


Step 1:

Struct <custom view name> : UIViewRepresentable {

}



For example

Struct WebView : UIViewRepresentable {

}


Step 2:
Xcode will then say “Webview does not conform to UiView Representable” and ask about protocol stubs -> hit Fix

Step 3:
Xcode will put in a statement

Typealias UIViewType = type     (where type is highlighted gray)


Replace type with the UIKit you want to represent, for example UIImagePickerView or WKWebView



Step 4:
Xcode will then say type <type you entered> does not conform, and will offer protocol stubs

Click Fix

Step 5:

Xcode has now filled out the protocol stubs for you! :) Now fill in the UIKit functions as appropriate!



NOTE:

a "coordinator" class will have to be made in order to pass data between views. I may create a file to cover that in the future.
