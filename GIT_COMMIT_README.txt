Commit Types

NEW             Added a feature that did not exist
REMOVE          Remove a feature that already exists
IMPROVE         Update a current feature
CHANGE          Redesign a current feature
FIX             Fix applied to a known or discovered bug
BUG             Reporting a bug and commenting out code/making anomaly known
OTHER           Any other commits that are uncategorized



Notes:
- IMPROVE and CHANGE are similar but not exactly the same. CHANGE may include improvements but is more focused on redesign rather than updating. Please use your best judgement.
- BUG is meant to comment out code/provide work around until a fix can be implemented. Please also describe the bug that is seen.

- Improvement Ideas welcome! I have not created a shared public workspace before, so I figured these simple rules could help keep commits consistent.
